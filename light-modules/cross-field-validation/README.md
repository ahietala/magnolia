## Features

What you choose in the first dropdown filters the choices in the second dropdown.

## Usage

This Magnolia light module decorates the Contacts app included in the Magnolia demo. The module replaces the standard Country field on the contact person address form with two fields: continents and countries. It doesn't necessarily make choosing a country any faster but is an example of how you could limit the choices the user needs to make to find the right choice if the number of options is very large.
